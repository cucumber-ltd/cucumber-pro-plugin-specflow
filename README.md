# Questions

- How to configure profile (now: from config file)
- Should we use INFO as default log level?
- How to configure the case, when you want to publish the results to a file, but not send them up?
- Setting cucumberpro.connection.ignoreerror cannot be applied
- Cannot override file-based config setting with ENV
